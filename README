Net-TCP-PtyServer

This module provides an easy-to-use interface to serving up
pseudo-terminals over network sockets.

A Perl script can run this module on the server. You calling the run
subroutine, and pass it a port number and a command-line. The server
will then open a listening connection on that port, and each time a
TELNET client connects, it will perform a double-fork, spawn a
pseudo-terminal, and execute the given command on the pseudo-terminal,
piping the results to the client-side pseudo-terminal.

The practical upshot of this is that you can easily allow users access
to programs running on your server. Of course, the programs have to
implement their own security or login arrangements as needed.
